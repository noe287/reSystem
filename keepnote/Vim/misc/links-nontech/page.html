So, how do we learn the right knowledge and have it pay off for us? The six points below serve as a framework to help you begin to answer this question.<b>&nbsp;I also created an <a href="http://bit.ly/2yffdpo_Medium_Article_6B-2">in-depth webinar on Learning How To Learn</a>&nbsp;that you can watch for free.</b><br/>
</span><ul><span style="font-size: 16pt"><li><b>Identify valuable knowledge at the right time. </b>The value of knowledge isn’t static. It changes as a function of how valuable other people consider it and how rare it is. As new technologies mature and reshape industries, there is often a deficit of people with the needed skills, which creates the potential for high compensation. Because of the high compensation, more people are quickly trained, and the average compensation decreases.</li>
<li><b>Learn and master that knowledge quickly. </b>Opportunity windows are temporary in nature. Individuals must take advantage of them when they see them. This means being able to learn new skills quickly. After reading thousands of books, I’ve found that <a href="http://bit.ly/2xKXNxo_Medium_Article_6">understanding and using mental models</a>&nbsp;is one of the most universal skills that EVERYONE should learn. It provides a strong foundation of knowledge that applies across every field. So when you jump into a new field, you have preexisting knowledge you can use to learn faster.</li>
<li><b>Communicate the value of your skills to others. </b>People with the same skills can command wildly different salaries and fees based on how well they’re able to communicate and persuade others. This ability convinces others that the skills you have are valuable is a “multiplier skill.” Many people spend years mastering an underlying technical skill and virtually no time mastering this multiplier skill.</li>
<li><b>Convert knowledge into money and results. </b>There are many ways to transform knowledge into value in your life. A few examples include finding and getting a job that pays well, getting a raise, building a successful business, selling your knowledge as a consultant, and building your reputation by becoming a thought leader.</li>
<li><b>Learn how to financially invest in learning to get the highest return. </b>Each of us needs to find the right “portfolio” of books, online courses, and certificate/degree programs to help us achieve our goals within our budget. To get the right portfolio, we need to apply financial terms — such as return on investment, risk management, hurdle rate, hedging, and diversification — to our thinking on knowledge investment.</li>
<li><b>Master the skill of <a href="http://bit.ly/2gbfx2e_Medium_Article_6B-3">learning how to learn</a>.</b>&nbsp;Doing so exponentially increases the value of every hour we devote to learning (our learning rate). Our learning rate determines how quickly our knowledge compounds over time. Consider someone who reads and retains one book a week versus someone who takes 10 days to read a book. Over the course of a year, a 30% difference compounds to one person reading 85 more books.</li>
