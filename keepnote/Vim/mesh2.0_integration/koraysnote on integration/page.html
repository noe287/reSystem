</head><body><span style="font-size: 15pt">Dependencies of new features on Mesh architecture: <br/>
<br/>
<b>Bilal</b>: Need to port the latest manager and <b>air-cdf.</b>&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Burak</b>: DPP is not fully compatible with Mesh1.0 but it can be worked out with additional effort. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Can</b>: DPP requires few wireless driver API - need to be checked. Devices scan for <b>gateway action frame</b>. Afterwards mesh2.0 handle the mesh formation. mesh1.0 needs to react to this action frame and do wps to form the mesh. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Bilal</b>: <b>DPP</b>&nbsp;depends on <b>wireless-controller</b>&nbsp;states (enrollee or registrar). <br/>
<br/>
<b>Can</b>: <b>Mesh islands</b>&nbsp;will not work with the automesh. Any feature depending on the mesh islands will not be compatible. Any app using mesh-ng transport layer need to be ported. Automesh supporting its own messaging system can be an alternative.  <br/>
<br/>
<b>Burak</b>: meshng transport layer working on sky automesh is doable - not the routing part just the messaging part. <br/>
Cloud based channel selection:  <ul><li>&nbsp;<b>Zero wait dfs </b>is being developed for 4930 - we are using wireless controller to do that. It is <b>Mesh 2.0</b>&nbsp;dependent. </li>
</ul>
Channel interference - depends on scan scheduler.  <br/>
<br/>
<b>Bilal</b>: We may need to port to version 7 of the drivers for scan scheduler - Broadcom API given with version 6 is not that comprehensive. <b>Version 7</b>&nbsp;is much more comprehensive - with v6 the measurement will not be precise. It is to do with how Broadcom do the measurement in the driver. It was provided as a separate patch on v7.   <br/>
<br/>
Guest network depends on the mesh ng. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Burak</b>: It is not doable without mesh-ng. <br/>
<br/>
TODO: Using service activation for feature control: Add it to the agenda of the governance meeting. This is a feature request - need to be discussed separately. <br/>
<br/>
(<b>Burak</b>&nbsp;- There is a parallel task targeting this using CDF). <br/>
<br/>
Client SSID prioritisation have dependency on driver version. It uses v7. <br/>
<br/>
Public WiFi over mesh (VLAN support) - It needs to be developed for Mesh 1.0. <br/>
<br/>
Real time event support - Steering sends two real time events. <br/>
Currently seems to be not related with Mesh 2.0 but <b>Can</b>&nbsp;says it depends on possible future requests which depends on Mesh 2.0. <br/>
<br/>
Memory optimisation - <b>Korhan</b>&nbsp;did run valgrind on 4920s. <br/>
